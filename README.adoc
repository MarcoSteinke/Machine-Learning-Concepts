# Machine Learning Concepts

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction:

This repository is used to experiment with Machine Learning and Data Science. I will use frameworks such as `Tensorflow`, `ML5` and others to build some applications
using Machine Learning. 

On the other side I will try and implement some of their functionality by hand for a better understanding.

## üîß Implementation:

Interested in how some principles from Machine Learning can be implemented without any frameworks? Then this section is your place to be.

Click the following link to find implementations:

https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/tree/main/implementation[click here]


### Text and Speech:

- text-prediction
- auto-completion like on android
- text-generation

### Models:

- training models to cluster political parties and decide on their political orientation

## ü§Ø Examples:

## Projects:

Some projects are already included in this repository. Projects which are suffixed with a (*) are still being implemented.

### Implementations:

* https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/tree/main/implementation/text-prediction[Text prediction using N-grams]

### ü§Ø ML5:

In this section I am going to use ML5 (built on Tensorflow) to try some Machine Learning concepts.

#### Current projects:

* image classification using ml5
* video detection using ml5
* knn-classification using 2d data

### Tensorflow.js:

#### Current projects:

* XOR
* x_squared(*)
