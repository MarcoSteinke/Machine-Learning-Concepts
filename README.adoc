# Machine Learning Concepts

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction:

This repository is used to experiment with Machine Learning and Data Science. I will use frameworks such as `Tensorflow`, `ML5` and others to build some applications
using Machine Learning. 

On the other side I will try and implement some of their functionality by myself for a better understanding. Thus I am going to implement the 
following concepts:

- kNN-Classifier
- k-Means-Clustering-Classifier
- Perceptron

## üîß Implementation:

Interested in how some principles from Machine Learning can be implemented without any frameworks? Then this section is your place to be.

Click the following link to find implementations:

## ü§Ø Examples:

In this section I am going to use ML5 (built on Tensorflow) to try some Machine Learning concepts.

## Todo:

* [ ] fix xor neural network
* [ ] fully translate presentation
* [ ] remove logos from presentation
* [ ] add xor with ml5
* [ ] add p5 to ml5
* [ ] implement projects
* [ ] collect repetetive code in library
