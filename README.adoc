# Train Machine Learning Models using ML5
This repository is a simple experiment which is going to help me understand the training of classification-models using ML5 (built on Tensorflow.js)

## 1. Setup:

Add the following lines to the head of your html file:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.1.9/lib/p5.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.5.0/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
```

Create a javascript file and reference it from your html.

  touch model.js
  
```html
<script src="model.js"></script>
```

Now you are able to use `ML5.js` and `P5.js` as Frameworks for Machine Learning and for Visualisation.

## 2. Creating the model:

First you have to setup some options to define how your model shall be defined:

```javascript
let options = {
    inputs: ['x', 'y'],
    outputs: ['label'],
    task: 'classification',
    debug: 'true'
};
```

* `inputs: ['x', 'y']` defines there will be two inputs which will be called `x` and `y`.
* `outputs: ['label']` does the same for the outputs. There will be one output called `label`.
* `task: 'classification'` tells ML5 to prepare the model to be a model used for `Classification`.
* `debug: 'true'` will provide some nice Visualisation and debugging tools.

Now after choosing the options you can create the model using ML5's `neuralNetwork` method:

```javascript
let model = ml5.neuralNetwork(options);
```

This will give you an empty model which has the inputs `x, y` and the output `label`. Your model is waiting to be fed with
training data.

## 3. Training the model:

At this point you have an empty model which is waiting to be trained. Therefore you first have to add some training data.
The data you are feeding will have to fit the following format:

```javascript
let inputs = {
    x: value,
    y: anotherValue
}
```

This is the format each entry of the inputs has to guarantee. The output on the other side will look like this:

```javascript
let target = {
     label: targetLabel
 };
```

TIP: As you can see the fields in put and target fit the names chosen in the options.

Now you can add any data which fits the format by setting the fields in `inputs` and `target` and afterwards call:

```javascript
model.addData(inputs, target);
```

When you are done with feeding your model with training data, you will now have to setup trainingOptions. This options will define
how much your model will train and how efficiently per iteration (called `EPOCH`).

Your trainingOptions can look like this:

```javascript
let trainingOptions = {
    epochs: 100
};
```

This will cause your model to run through 100 cycles (`EPOCH`) while training. The data you fed your model with will be put into random order and fed to your model 
once per epoch to increase its learning effect. You can also add `batchSize` to the trainingOptions, to define an amount of training data which is given per batch.

Before you can now train your model, your training data has to be `normalized` such that the model can handle the values much better. Normalizing the training data will
cause them to be translated into values between 0 and 1. This can be done via:

```javascript
model.normalizeData();
```

After this is done, you can finally run:

```javascript
model.train(trainingOptions, whileTraining, finishedTraining);
```

As you can see in the call, you will also have to implement methods `whileTraining` and `finishedTraining`.

|===
| Method | Execution

| whileTraining | once per epoch
| finishedTraining | after training complete
|===

The methods can be implemented such as:

```javascript
function whileTraining(epoch, loss) {
    console.log([epoch, loss].join(','));
}
```

TIP: The parameters epoch and loss will be given be ML5 and will be automatically set.

```javascript
function finishedTraining() {
    console.log('finished');
}
```

Your model will now be trained and you will also see a graph which is presenting the current training progress.

`graph will be added here`

TIP: This graph is displayed because of `debug: 'true'` in the options.

## 4. Using the trained model:

At this point your model has completed its training. You can now use the trained model to predict the results
of new inputs. Therefore your model will always output a set of probabilities which represent the probabilities of
the different possible outputs.


To call the trained model and use it, you can for example call

    model.classify(inputs, gotResults);

Where `inputs` is an object including two inputs such that

```javascript
let inputs = {
    x: 'some Value'
    y: 'another Value'
}
```

You also need to implement the method `gotResults`:

```javascript
function gotResults(error, results) {

    // some code
}
```

The method gets two parameters, where error is possibly `NULL` or can be a value.
Additionally you get the results of the classification which will look something like this:

```javascript
console.log(results)
```

    {output1: 0.987, output2: 0.013}

The results represent the weightings of the classification, so how much your input suits the different
results from the training.



## 5. Interesting Project ideas:

### 5.1 Inheritage guesser:

Train a model which gets a forename and surname and then returns weights where the person could be from.

https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Train-Machine-Learning-Models-using-ML5/tree/main/Projects/inheritage[go to]

### 5.2 Gender guesser:

Train a model which gets a forename and shall answer with the right gender.

## 6. How to generate data sets for projects from `5`:

To generate suitting datasets for the projects mentioned in chapter `5` you can use https://www.randomuser.me/api[`https://www.randomuser.me/api`].

`randomuser.me` offers a very nice API to generate person data. You can receive a single person or a list of them and configure them by using
a lot of API parameters.

With calling `randomuser.me/api` you obtain a completely random person without any specific information.

    curl -G http://www.randomuser.me/api
