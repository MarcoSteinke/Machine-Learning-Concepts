# Machine Learning Resources

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction:

A personal collection of Machine Learning / Data Science / AI resources. This collections consists of papers, blog posts, tutorials and also
self-trained models or reimplementations of widespread machine learning algorithms.

I develop most mockups inside of this repository and also prepare blog posts about the topics collected in this repository. Feel free to try out
some of my code examples or read some of the resources which are included in this repository!

## üìù Blog:

This repository also includes blog posts which I am working on and also blog posts which were already released.

### Currently working on:

- https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Resources/tree/main/implementation/political-parties[Using Neural Networks to learn some predictions for political contexts]

Some finished blog posts can be found here:

- https://bestofcode.net/blog/text-prediction/[Text Prediction using Bigrams and Markov Models]
- https://bestofcode.net/blog/text-generation/[Text Generation using Bigrams]

There are also live demos of the code snippets from my blog posts. Check out:

- https://bestofcode.net/Applications/text-prediction/[Text prediction demo]
- https://bestofcode.net/Applications/text-generation/[Text generation demo]

## üîß Implementation:

Interested in how some principles from Machine Learning can be implemented without any frameworks? Then this section is your place to be.

Click the following link to find implementations:

https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/tree/main/implementation[click here]


### Text and Speech:

- text-prediction
- auto-completion like on android
- text-generation

### Models:

- training models to cluster political parties and decide on their political orientation

## ü§Ø Examples:

## Projects:

Some projects are already included in this repository. Projects which are suffixed with a (*) are still being implemented.

### Implementations:

* https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/tree/main/implementation/text-prediction[Text prediction using N-grams]

### ü§Ø ML5:

In this section I am going to use ML5 (built on Tensorflow) to try some Machine Learning concepts.

#### Current projects:

* image classification using ml5
* video detection using ml5
* knn-classification using 2d data

Click the following link to find examples:

### Tensorflow.js:

#### Current projects:

* XOR
* x_squared(*)
