# Machine Learning Concepts

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction:

This repository is used to experiment with Machine Learning and Data Science. I will use frameworks such as `Tensorflow`, `ML5` and others to build some applications
using Machine Learning. 

On the other side I will try and implement some of their functionality by myself for a better understanding. Thus I am going to implement the 
following concepts:

- kNN-Classifier
- k-Means-Clustering-Classifier
- Perceptron

## üîß Implementation:

Interested in how some principles from Machine Learning can be implemented without any frameworks? Then this section is your place to be.

Click the following link to find implementations:

## ü§Ø Examples:

## Projects:

Some projects are already included in this repository. Projects which are suffixed with a (*) are still being implemented.

### ü§Ø ML5:

In this section I am going to use ML5 (built on Tensorflow) to try some Machine Learning concepts.

#### Current projects:

* image classification using ml5
* video detection using ml5
* knn-classification using 2d data

### Tensorflow.js:

#### Current projects:

* XOR
* x_squared(*)

## Todo:

* [x] fix xor neural network
* [ ] fully translate presentation
* [ ] remove logos from presentation
* [ ] add xor with ml5
* [ ] add p5 to ml5
* [ ] implement projects
* [ ] collect repetetive code in library
* [ ] write own implementation of neural networks inspired by https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/
