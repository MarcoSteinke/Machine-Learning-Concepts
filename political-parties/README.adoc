# Political Parties:

## Introduction:

In this project I want to focus on german parties such as CDU/CSU, SPD, B90/Gr체ne, FPD, Linke and apply different metrics to find out how different representations of the parties properties are effected 
and which metric may reveal relations, which could be interesting.

The first important aspect is how parties can be represented.

My naive approach would be using two vectors per party. Let the vectors be called 창 and 청. Both vectors are `n-dimensional`, where `n` is the amount of `topics` used to represent all parties. So all vectors will have the same dimension in this model.

Vector 창 describes 

## Datasets:

The source for this model will be the data from https://parteivergleich.eu/index.php?Wahl=Bundestagswahl_2021_Parteien[this link (parteivergleich.eu)]

## Algorithm:

- use vectors and different metrics to perform good in unsupervised learning for the clustering
- transform vectors to train a neural network which shall be able to measure a parties political orientation


## Goal:

- build an AI which is able to cluster parties by their topics.
- it shall be able to tell if a party is left, central or right
- let users answer questions to find out about his/her political orientation
