# Political Parties:

## Introduction:

In this project I want to focus on german parties such as CDU/CSU, SPD, B90/Gr체ne, FPD, Linke and apply different metrics to find out how different representations of the parties properties are effected 
and which metric may reveal relations, which could be interesting.

The first important aspect is how parties can be represented.

The source for this model will be the data from https://parteivergleich.eu/index.php?Wahl=Bundestagswahl_2021_Parteien[this link (parteivergleich.eu)]
