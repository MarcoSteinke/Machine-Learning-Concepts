# Political Parties:

## Introduction:

In this project I want to focus on german parties such as CDU/CSU, SPD, B90/Gr√ºne, FPD, Linke and apply different metrics to find out how different representations of the parties properties are effected 
and which metric may reveal relations, which could be interesting.
