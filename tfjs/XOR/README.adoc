# XOR using Tensorflow.js

In this project I want to generate a neural Network which is able to learn the XOR function.

## XOR function:

```javascript
const xor = (x,y) => x ^ y;
```

More to be added soon.

## Implementation:

```javascript
// Build and compile model.
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [2]}));
model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError'});
```

* `tf.sequential()` generates a linear neural network.
* the input layer expects tensors with the form [a, b] and returns a single scalar
* the output will be optimized via sgd and the loss will be measured using MSE
