# Political Parties:

## 1. Introduction:

In this project I want to focus on german parties such as CDU/CSU, SPD, B90/Grüne, FPD, Linke and apply different metrics to find out how different representations of the parties properties are effected 
and which metric may reveal relations, which could be interesting.

The first important aspect is how parties can be represented.

My naive approach would be using two vectors per party. Let the vectors be called â and û. Both vectors are `n-dimensional`, where `n` is the amount of `topics` used to represent all parties. So all vectors will have the same dimension in this model.

## 2. Structure:

### 2.1 Datasets:

The source for this model will be the data from https://parteivergleich.eu/index.php?Wahl=Bundestagswahl_2021_Parteien[this link (parteivergleich.eu)]

### 2.2 Algorithm:

- use vectors and different metrics to perform good in unsupervised learning for the clustering
- transform vectors to train a neural network which shall be able to measure a parties political orientation


## 2.3 Goal:

- build an AI which is able to cluster parties by their topics.
- it shall be able to tell if a party is left, central or right
- let users answer questions to find out about his/her political orientation

## 3. Derivation:

For the actual derivation of the concept I first have to analyze the data presented on parteivergleich.eu!

As already mentioned before I want to use vectors which will be the input to a clustering algorithm and also a neural network and will be used as unlabeled data for the unsupervised clustering algorithm and as labeled data for the neural network at the same time.

So there will be two AI models trained at the same time which together form the complete model for this project.

### 3.1 Dimension of the data:

To find out the dimension of the data I began to do some analysis and formatting of the data, to see what I am dealing with.

Some excerpts of the first overview can be found
https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/blob/main/implementation/political-parties/parteivergleich.eu-1633706099268.adoc[here]

As a result I first counted each line of the input and it resulted in 88 lines.

In the next step which can be found https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Concepts/blob/main/implementation/political-parties/parteivergleich.eu-1633706099268.adoc#directly-map-tables-into-questions-to-proof-the-amount-88-by-the-amount-of-the-actual-questions-as-strings[here] I decided to try to filter for all questions and again store them in an array, but this time as raw strings and then determine the array's length. This did also result in 88.

The following line shows the query which finally gave me the amount of questions with all questions as strings:

```javascript
[...[...document.querySelectorAll(".tabscroll")].map(table => [...table.firstElementChild.rows]).map(array => array.splice(1, array.length-2))].flat().map(row => row.firstElementChild.innerText)
```

Since the parties will be represented by their answers to these questions and will therefore form according vectors, the vectors dimension will be 88!

### 3.2 List of all parties:

The next step is to create a list of all parties for testing purposes and better understanding of the data.

The following slice gives the names of all 36 parties:

```javascript
[...document.querySelector("#aussen > div.rand10px > div:nth-child(9) > table > tbody > tr:nth-child(1)").cells].map(c => c.innerText).slice(2, [...document.querySelector("#aussen > div.rand10px > div:nth-child(9) > table > tbody > tr:nth-child(1)").cells].length)

(36) ['AfD', 'berg-\npartei', 'Bayern-\npartei', 'Bündnis\nC', 'BÜNDNIS\n21', 'BüSo', 'CDU*', 'CSU*', 'DiB', 'Die\nGrauen', 'Die\nHumanisten', 'DIE\nLINKE', 'DKP', 'du.\nDie Urbane.', 'FAMILIE', 'FDP', 'FREIE\nWÄHLER', 'Gesundheits-\nforschung', 'Graue\nPanther', 'GRÜNE', 'Klimaliste\nBW', 'LIEBE', 'MENSCHLICHE\nWELT', 'MLPD', 'NPD', 'ÖDP', 'PdF', 'PIRATEN', 'SGP', 'DIE\nSONSTIGEN', 'SPD', 'THP', 'Tierschutz-\nallianz', 'Tierschutz-\npartei', 'UNABHÄNGIGE', 'V-Partei³']
```

Which leads to the result:

```javascript
0: "AfD"
1: "berg-\npartei"
2: "Bayern-\npartei"
3: "Bündnis\nC"
4: "BÜNDNIS\n21"
5: "BüSo"
6: "CDU*"
7: "CSU*"
8: "DiB"
9: "Die\nGrauen"
10: "Die\nHumanisten"
11: "DIE\nLINKE"
12: "DKP"
13: "du.\nDie Urbane."
14: "FAMILIE"
15: "FDP"
16: "FREIE\nWÄHLER"
17: "Gesundheits-\nforschung"
18: "Graue\nPanther"
19: "GRÜNE"
20: "Klimaliste\nBW"
21: "LIEBE"
22: "MENSCHLICHE\nWELT"
23: "MLPD"
24: "NPD"
25: "ÖDP"
26: "PdF"
27: "PIRATEN"
28: "SGP"
29: "DIE\nSONSTIGEN"
30: "SPD"
31: "THP"
32: "Tierschutz-\nallianz"
33: "Tierschutz-\npartei"
34: "UNABHÄNGIGE"
35: "V-Partei³"
```

But as you can see, the names of the parties do include some formatting, which has to be replaced by editing the query!

```javascript
[...document.querySelector("#aussen > div.rand10px > div:nth-child(9) > table > tbody > tr:nth-child(1)").cells].map(c => c.innerText).slice(2, [...document.querySelector("#aussen > div.rand10px > div:nth-child(9) > table > tbody > tr:nth-child(1)").cells].length).map(party => party.replace("\n", ""))
```

This results in:

```javascript
0: "AfD"
1: "berg-partei"
2: "Bayern-partei"
3: "BündnisC"
4: "BÜNDNIS21"
5: "BüSo"
6: "CDU*"
7: "CSU*"
8: "DiB"
9: "DieGrauen"
10: "DieHumanisten"
11: "DIELINKE"
12: "DKP"
13: "du.Die Urbane."
14: "FAMILIE"
15: "FDP"
16: "FREIEWÄHLER"
17: "Gesundheits-forschung"
18: "GrauePanther"
19: "GRÜNE"
20: "KlimalisteBW"
21: "LIEBE"
22: "MENSCHLICHEWELT"
23: "MLPD"
24: "NPD"
25: "ÖDP"
26: "PdF"
27: "PIRATEN"
28: "SGP"
29: "DIESONSTIGEN"
30: "SPD"
31: "THP"
32: "Tierschutz-allianz"
33: "Tierschutz-partei"
34: "UNABHÄNGIGE"
35: "V-Partei³"
```

Now there are all parties names with some formatting.
