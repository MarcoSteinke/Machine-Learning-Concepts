# 5. Translations:

## 5.1 Introduction:

In this chapter I want to discuss the possibilities of translating text from one language to another by using AI.

The following questions are interesting to me:

- is my self-developed system able to translate texts reliably?
- how well does my model translate texts?
- how does the scientific model for translations look like?
- how does the quality of my model change by modifying the amount of words in the dictionary?

So the first step would be to implement the actual translation model!

## 5.2 Implementation:

The translator will be able to translate German language into english language.

Therefore it will be using a database which represents a english<~>German dictionary.

This means there must be different components which have to be implemented!

### 5.2.1 Dictionary:

The dictionary for now is a PDF which consists of pages filled with German english word pairs. Those have to be processed and stored into a Map in Javascript.
