# 5. Translations:

## 5.1 Introduction:

In this chapter I want to discuss the possibilities of translating text from one language to another by using AI.

The following questions are interesting to me:

- is my self-developed system able to translate texts reliably?
- how well does my model translate texts?
- how does the scientific model for translations look like?
- how does the quality of my model change by modifying the amount of words in the dictionary?

So the first step would be to implement the actual translation model!

## 5.2 Implementation:

TBD
