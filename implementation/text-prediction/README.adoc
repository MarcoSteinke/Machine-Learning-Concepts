# Text Prediction using Bigrams and Markov Models:

## 1. Introduction:

For the implementation of text prediction I am using the concept of Markov Models, which allows me to calculate the probabilities of consecutively events.
I will first explain what a Markov Model is.

## 2. Hidden Markov Model:

To explain a Markov Model it is important to start by understanding what a Markov Chain is.

### 2.1 Markov-Chain
A Markov Chain is a stochastic model, which models a sequence of random variables. It is assumed that states in the future 
only depend on a limited amount of previous states (Markov Adoption)
